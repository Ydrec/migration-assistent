# migration-assistent
Batch script to migrate old modpack instance

Throw migrationassistant.bat, files_to_keep.txt, files_to_disable.txt in the instance folder(folder containing .minecraft) of modpack you want to update

Throw new pack zip file into same folder and run migrationassistant.bat

Restart your launcher after migration is finished

The code is subpar so it can take a minute to parse all files.
